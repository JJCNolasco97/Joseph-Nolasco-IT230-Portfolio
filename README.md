1) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
  The requirements and goals of the application I developed were to allow the user to enter a number assigned to a course in order to register for the course. When a course number is inputted again, it prompts
the user that the course has already been registered. If a user enters an input that is out of the acceptable range, they are prompted with a message saying that it is not a recognized course. Each course
is worth 3 credit hours. Once the user registers 9 credit hours worth of courses, any additional attempt to register for a course will prompt a message saying that they are unable to register for more than
9 credit hours. This application was designed to address the needs to register for courses.

2) What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
   While developing this application, some things I did particularly well on were making the use of logical operators, switch statements, methods, classes, looping, and input validation. I also made sure to
   maintain a clear and organized structure throughout my coding.

3) Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
   The console allows the programmer to code how the program works while the WPF application design allows the programmer to tie their program to a visual layout. Some features that were necessary to
   support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app were text boxes, text blocks, list boxes, buttons, labels, and a combo box. The UI design keep users in mind by have a clear and organized
   layout, as well as using labels and text to help navigate the user with using the application. I believe the design was successful because it is simple yet effective and also helps guide the user so
   they are not able to be confused when using the application.

5) How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
  First I start off by working on the specific classes or methods required. By doing this I can focus on a specific issue at a time. I also made use of the error list to tackle a lot of the syntax errors and
made use of step-into debugging. For logic errors I ran multiple test runs of my program while throwing multiple inputs in to see how the program outputs. This allowed me to fix the logic errors that were
more difficult to spot right away. By continuing to practice these techniques and strategies, I can more efficiently implement them in the future.

6) Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
  When connecting the code from the console to the WPF, I had to be innovative on which components I wanted to use and how I was going to do it. I had to refer to the Microsoft documentation quite
frequently in order to overcome certain challenges.
